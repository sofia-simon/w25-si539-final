                <h2>Individualized Career Support</h2>
    
                <p class="body-1">The Career Development Office (CDO) has a team of career coaches who work with students 1:1 to directly support students in achieving their career-related goals. This looks different from student to student and session to session. We use a coaching model centered around what the student individually needs at the moment.</p>
    
                <p class="body-1">Coaching sessions might be question-oriented, a review of best practices and resources, a review of documents' content, reflection on well-being in the job search, and practice.</p>

                <p class="body-1">The CDO also hires and trains a team of Peer Career Coaches to meet with BSI and master's students at UMSI. This is a valuable opportunity to receive peer coaching from students who have successfully gone through the internship/job search process. These students have applied their UMSI knowledge to diverse roles and industries.</p>

            <h2>Preparing for a Coaching Session</h2>

            <p class="body-1">Career coaching is a collaborative process that empowers students with the knowledge and confidence to take the next steps in their career journey. Appointments are tailored to address your individualized career goals and the challenges you're facing.</p>

            <p class="body-1">Students play an active role throughout the process, engaging in self-reflection, asking questions, brainstorming possible solutions, and implementing the action plans co-created with your career coach. Through career coaching, coaches will challenge students, provide a safe space to try new things, and be by students' side to celebrate their success.</p>

            <h3>How to Prepare</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Pause & reflect on your goals - Where are you in the process?</li>
                <li>Be timely - Think about what your most pressing concern is</li>
                <li>Be honest - What are you worried or anxious about?</li>
                <li>Define your objectives - Try to name the priority items and what you need help on</li>
                <li>If you're unsure, that's okay — coaches will help you figure it out</li>
                <li>Mentally prepare for feedback and questions</li>
            </ul>
